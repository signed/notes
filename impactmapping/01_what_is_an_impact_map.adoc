Goal - Why do we want to achieve it

Actors - Whose behaviour do we want to impact?

Important actors are those who can significantly influence the success of a project
Identify them early, be specific who they are and try to define them in this order
- specific individuals
- user personas
- role or job title
- group or department

e.g.
- organizers that want to run a MeetNow
- users on a free plan

Impacts - Set the actors in the perspective of the business goal

- How should an actors behaviour change?
- How can they help us achieve the goal?
- How can they obstruct or prevent us from succeeding?

e.g.
- sign up without having to provide an email address
- does not have to provide invoice data
